\section*{Introduction}

\emph{Planck--Cell Thermal Physics} reformulates thermodynamics in the rate
language of the tick medium, where temperature and entropy flow express the
bookkeeping of microscopic updates.  Heat transfer, conduction, and radiation
become structured channels of tick throughput satisfying $\sigma \ge 0$.
Temperature is identified as $T = \dot{Q}/\dot{S}_{\mathrm{phys}}$, linking
macroscopic observables to per--tick entropy generation.  The treatment remains
within established thermodynamics while embedding it in the same causal--rate
framework that governs light, mass, and gravity, thereby anchoring the
thermodynamic arrow of time in the fundamental tick direction.
