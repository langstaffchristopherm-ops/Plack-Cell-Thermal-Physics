\section*{Scope and falsifiability}
This paper reformulates classical thermodynamics within the
\emph{Planck-Cell S/t framework}, expressing temperature and heat flow as
entropy-tick rates of the underlying medium.  It retains standard local
balance laws,
\(\partial_t s + \nabla\!\cdot\! j_S = \sigma \ge 0\),
and interprets the second law as a bookkeeping rule on tick throughput.
All claims apply to interior regions of a bounded-degree, approximately
isotropic adjacency network in which no entity advances more than one hop
per global tick.
The framework is falsified by any reproducible breakdown of those rate
relations or by violation of the non-negativity of entropy production.
Immediate falsifiers include:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item experimentally measurable negative entropy production
        ($\sigma < 0$) in a closed or adiabatic system;
  \item persistent failure of the entropy-flux balance
        \(\dot{S}_{\mathrm{phys}} = \sum_i \dot{Q}_i/T_i + \sigma\)
        under steady conditions;
  \item deviation of radiative entropy throughput from the near-blackbody
        law \(\dot{S}_{\mathrm{rad}} = \tfrac{4}{3}P/T\) beyond experimental
        uncertainty;
  \item violation of the equilibrium tick-rate equality
        (\(T_1 \ne T_2\) at zero net heat flux) in controlled systems.
\end{enumerate}
Any confirmed case of negative local~$\sigma$, imbalance in measured
entropy flux, or systematic departure from the rate-based predictions
would falsify the thermodynamic layer of the framework.
